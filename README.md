# Allan_dev_laser_locking
This script is used to calculate fractional frequency Allan deviation of the 780 nm laser which is locked to Rubidium cell by using modulation transfer method. This is compare the two case of laser locking (low intensity and high intensity pump beam). WS8-10 wavelength Meter is used to measure the wavelenght of laser while it is locked.

The laser setup is shown below
